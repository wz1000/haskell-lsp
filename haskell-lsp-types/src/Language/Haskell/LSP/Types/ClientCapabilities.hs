New in 3.0

-----------

ClientCapabilities

now define capabilities for dynamic registration, workspace and text document
features the client supports. The experimental can be used to pass experimential
capabilities under development. For future compatibility a ClientCapabilities
object literal can have more properties set than currently defined. Servers
receiving a ClientCapabilities object literal with unknown properties should
ignore these properties. A missing property should be interpreted as an absence
of the capability. If a property is missing that defines sub properties all sub
properties should be interpreted as an absence of the capability.

Client capabilities got introduced with the version 3.0 of the protocol. They
therefore only describe capabilities that got introduced in 3.x or later.
Capabilities that existed in the 2.x version of the protocol are still mandatory
for clients. Clients cannot opt out of providing them. So even if a client omits
the ClientCapabilities.textDocument.synchronization it is still required that
the client provides text document synchronization (e.g. open, changed and close
notifications).
